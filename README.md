# Sagar Patel - Data Analysis Portfolio

## About

Hi, I'm Sagar! I hold a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) degree in Computer Science (University of Illinois - Springfield). I had worked in the hospitality industry for 5 years and am currently working as a Datacenter technician. My goal is to eventually break my way into Data Analytics because of my interests of analyzing different datasets and coming up with insights for better understanding.

This is a repository to showcase skills and share projects,
